Background
----------
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Nowadays, we are living such a busy and rush life. Happy or sad, good or terrible, we can hardly find someone to share our true feelings and ideas. 

To solve this kind of problem, we want to create a platform that people can open his or her heart without any hesitation by making the contact **anonymous**. 

Introduction of Project Details
----------
In 2017 Autumn, the Agony Bot on Telegram was created under the environment stated above. For your convenience of understanding our codes, please kindly download all the file in a packed zip and then unzip it. 

The use of this bot has been detailed stated in the documentation. Currently we are not keeping the local sever & database of this bot on telegram.

If you want to put the function of this bot to your own bot, do remember to **input your own unique API token number** in every python file. **__DO NOT__** directly run user2.py which will may cause unnecessary inconvenience.

Before your leap
----------
After finishing filling your own Telegram API token received from **Bot Father**, run **user2.py** and then see the command window reporting the status of MySQL database. Before running, your desktop or local sever provider should be conected to Internet and installed with **MySQL benchmark** correctcly. 

Edit **publish.py** with messages that you want to publish to all the bot followers on the telegram. Run that file to publish.

You can now enjoy the anonymous chat/interactions with your friends.

Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
----------
Conducted by the School of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University, the general assessment and grading of this project is finished. Python codes are contributed by our Team, which consists 5 players: **`Chen Taoyu`**, **`Yang Jingyi`**, **`Guo Mukun`**, **`Chen Feiyu`** and **`Luo Jinqi`**. Please feel free to report any bug you find.
